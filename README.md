I am a CTO, Software Architect, and Software Engineer.

My journey into technology started when I was 8 years old, the day I received my first laptop. From that moment on, I began exploring, experimenting, breaking things, and rebuilding them to understand how they worked. What started as curiosity quickly became obsession, and eventually a profession.

I have been programming since my early teens and have gone through every stage of the engineering lifecycle: small scripts, automation tools, community utilities, open-source projects, complex systems, distributed architectures, and technical leadership. Today, my primary focus is designing scalable systems, making high-impact technical decisions, and building software that is robust, maintainable, and well-engineered.

For me, programming is not just writing code. It is about designing systems that remain correct, scalable, and understandable over time.
